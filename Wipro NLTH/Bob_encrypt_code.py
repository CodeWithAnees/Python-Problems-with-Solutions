# Bob encrypt code
# Bob has to send a secret code S to his boss. He designs a method to encrypt the code using two key values N and M. The formula that he uses to develop the encrypted code is shown below. (((S^N % 10)^M)%1000000007) Write an algorithm to help Bob encrypt the code.

# Input Format:

# The input consists of three space-separated integers â€“ S, N and M, representing the secret code, the first key value and the second key value, respectively.

# Output Format:

# Print an integer representing the code encrypted by Bob.

# Constraints:

# 1 < S < 109

# O < N, M < 109

# Sample Input:

# 2 3 4

# Sample Output:

# 4096

# Explanation:

# S = 2, N = 3, M = 4 and the formula of the encrypted code is:

# (((S^N % 10)^M)% 1000000007)

# (((2^3 % 10)^4)% 1000000007) = 4096

# So, the output is 4096.

S = int(input())
N = int(input())
M = int(input())

print((((S**N)%10)**M)%1000000007)
